      Five hundred years ago, the chief of an upper hexagon came upon a book as
      confusing as the others, but which had nearly two pages of
      <span class="chinese" id="homogenous">相似的</span>
      <span class="translate" id="homogenousT"> </span>
      lines. He showed his find to a wandering
      <span class="spanish" id="decoder">descifrador </span>
      <span class="translate" id="decoderT"> </span>
       who told him the lines were writtenin Portuguese; others said they were Yiddish.
      Within a century, the language was established:
      <span class="spanish" id="lithuanian">un dialecto samoyedo-lituano del guaraní,</span>
      <span class="translate" id="lithuanianT"></span>
      with classical Arabian inflections. The content was also deciphered:
      some notions of combinative analysis, illustrated with examples of variations with
      <span class="chinese" id="repetition">无限反复. </span>
      <span class="translate" id="repetitionT"> </span>
      These examples made it possible for a librarian of genius to discover
      <span class="spanish" id="law">la ley fundamental de la Biblioteca</span>
      <span class="translate" id="lawT"> </span>.
      This thinker observed that all the books, no matter how diverse they might be, are made up of the same elements:
      <span class="chinese" id="symbol">空格，句点，逗点，二十二个字母。</span>
      <span class="translate" id="symbolT"></span>
      He also alleged a fact which travelers have confirmed:
      <span class="spanish" id="identical"> No hay en la vasta Biblioteca, dos libros idénticos. </span>
      <span class="translate" id="identicalT"> </span>
      From these two incontrovertible premises he deduced that the Library is total and that its shelves register
      <span class="chinese" id="combination">全部可能实现的组合</span>
      <span class="translate" id="combinationT"> </span>
      of the twenty-odd orthographical symbols (a number which, though extremely vast, is not
      <span class="spanish" id="test">infinito</span>
      ): Everything: the minutely detailed history of the future, the archangels' autobiographies,
      <span class="chinese" id="faithful">图书馆的准确的目录</span>
      <span class="translate" id="faithfulT"> </span>
      ,thousands and thousands of false catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of those
      catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel
      of Basilides, the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on the commentary on that
      gospel, the true story of your death, the translation of every book in all languages,
      the interpolations of every book in all books.
